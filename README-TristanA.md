***GitHub is like Youtube/Wikipedia for Programmers - Records of Content Creation are easily accessible, and collaboration, commenting, and revising/remixing are both possible and encouraged.
Forking a Repository seems like it will be very helpful in the future, especially if I just want to mess around with someone else's code to gain more practical insight.
Seems like a very cooperation-centric environment which is exciting.***
